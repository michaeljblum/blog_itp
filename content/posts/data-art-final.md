For my data art final, I wanted to build something that doesn't just live on a flat screen, but rather something that has depth and affords a greater range of experience than mouse/trackpad interaction, scrolling, scanning, etc. 

My attention, therefore, was turned toward VR (still technically based on a flat screen——or screens, namely two very little ones stationed an inch or so away your eyeballs, but offering a very different experience than that offered on personal computer nevertheless). 

I wanted build an experience that would allow the user to get some sense of the data that is maybe inaccessible when simply looking at and processing a visualization (bar chart, line graph, tree graph, etc.) on their laptop screen. A data visualization built for VR could allow for the user to feel the scale of the data more intimately or viscerally than might be possible in their more conventional, quotidian experiences with these aforementioned visualizations on screens. 

So I built a navigable, responsive data visualization in Unreal Engine 4, featuring meshes procedurally generated from climate change data and a motion controller pawn with a bespoke climbing locomotion system, effectively allowing——and inviting——the user to climb the data.

I wanted the user to develop a sense for the steep incline of the climate warming data by being tasked with exerting the energy to physically, manually scale it, thereby developing a more intimate, bodily understanding of the severity and rapidness of the change over time.
