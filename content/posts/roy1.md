<h5>“...it is not the intelligence that is a filing cabinet; it is the filing cabinet that is an intelligence.” Gaston Bachelard</h5>

The discussions had during our first session of Rest of You brought to mind a piece by Freud that I’ve always found interesting as it relates—prophetically, if also incidentally— to computation and some of the technological advances that Freud, a clinical psycho-analyst writing in 1925, could not have rationally anticipated (advances such as exponential increase in storage and processing power, graphical user interfaces, and widespread accessibility—the personal computer). 

In this piece, titled “A Note on the Mystic Writing Pad,” (1925) Freud compares apparatuses we use for recording information as a means of extending our memory, from the standard paper pad to chalkboard. He ultimately finds both inadequate: “Thus an unlimited receptive capacity and a retention of permanent traces seem to be mutually exclusive properties in the apparatus which we use as substitutes for our memory: either the receptive surface must be renewed [i.e. a new sheet of paper must be produced] or the note must be destroyed [we must erase and/or write over the previous note with another].”

Freud’s solution to this problem is hypothetical, an exercise in imagination—he proposes something he calls the mystic writing pad, which can “provide both an ever-ready receptive surface and permanent traces of the notes that have been made upon it.”

The computer as it is known today, with its near-infinite (especially owing to cloud storage) encyclopedic capabilities, with the speed and efficiency with which it can fetch data (whether grep-ing in the command line or searching in a GUI equivalent) is a lot like this mystic writing pad. And in this way, the computer is a positively revolutionary mnemic system. But! The computer, is no magical artifact, but a deeply secular machinery of bits and pixels, folders and files, regular expressions and data types. It is a machinery, moreover, built by humans and designed to conform to their habits, inclinations, and needs (while also shaping these same habits, inclinations, and needs, *but more on that later*). It is a machinery that, for the most part (though this will eventually cease to be the case), is operated chiefly by humans. The computer, therefore, despite its seemingly magical properties of tremendous storage and speed, also reproduces, mimics, or enables several other properties we might call uniquely human—properties such as forgetting or repression. 

Just as there is a hygiene of the mind—we might forget or repress memories too painful, distracting, or bothersome to maintain in consciousness—so there too is a hygiene of the machine—spam filters intercept mail that algorithms determine are unwanted, files are nested in folders which are in turn nested in folders, soon to be forgotten, in an effort to maintain the cleanliness of our workspace—which is after all merely a ~15” window of light.

Now, if any of this sounds confusing, that’s because it is. You might be asking, for example: Well, isn’t it the human operating the computer who is nesting all those files and folders? or Isn’t the content “repressed” in the spam folder a whole lot less meaningful than that repressed in the human system?

What I’d like to suggest is that the answers to these questions are less intuitive than they may seem at first blush.
