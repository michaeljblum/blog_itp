**ROPE SUPERIOR TO LEATHER**

[*Advert.*]

Fibrous Material Rapidly Supplanting Belting in American and European Mills and Factories.

For 20 years there has been an increasing use in this country of manila rope for power transmission in mills and factories in place of leather belting. In English factories ropes superseded belting long ago, and their use is nearly universal. In the United States the change that has taken place began with the acquisition of the Philippine islands where, as everybody knows, the Manila hemp flourishes. The fiber of the hemp varies in length from 6 to 12 feet. It is said to possess greater tensile strength than any other fiber known, exceeding 50,000 pounds per square inch. Rope drives, as transmission ropes are called, possess the advantage of noiselessness, owing to their flexibility and to the existence of an air passage in the grooves between the rope and the sheath.

**MULE KICKS MAN AND DIES**

[*Local news. Note: This one has quite an idiosyncratic first sentence. Copied down precisely as printed in the paper.*]

Hunstville, Alaska. 
The claim of Joseph Jones to hospital attaches that he had some bean was borne out when his story that he had been kicked by a mule on the head and that as a result the animal was lying helpless with a broken leg, was investigated and found to be true. Jones said his way was blocked by a stray mule and he made a threatening gesture to frighten it away. It refused to stampede, however, meeting the assault with a well-directed kick to the brow. The muleâ€™s leg was broken in two places. It was pronounced a helpless cripple and shot. Jones will recover.

You watch the beady lights of the Jersey coast rise like a careless necklace in the west, and you think how inured to wonders our day must be, for we scarcely lift our eyes to achievements that would have brought our grandfathers to their knees, full of praise, as for a miracle.
