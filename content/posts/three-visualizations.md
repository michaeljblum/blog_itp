For this assignment, we were tasked with creating three visualizations of the same dataset, the population of foreign immigrants, divided on the basis of their country of origin, living in the U.S. around the year ~2014 (the data was published as a part of the 1-year American Community Service in 2015). 

I created the following single-page web app to host my three visualizations: https://michaeljblum.github.io/Week_1_Assignment/.

The first visualization is a scatterplot, the second is a circle pack, and the third is a conventional bar chart. All three visualizations were created chiefly using the [D3](https://d3js.org/). 

Commentary on the form, process, and decision-making involved in my visualizations can be found on the single-page web app hosting them.
