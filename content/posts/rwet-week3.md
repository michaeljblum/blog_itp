The idea behind this assignment, for me, was to gain more comfortable footing with procedurally generating poetry with Python that, at least six or seven out of ten times, produced something worthwhile. Given this standard, my first attempt was a failure, and I'll be sure to revisit it and reshape it going forward. 

What I'd like to do going forward is separate words out into parts of speech and also set up a scenario where singular and plural are distinguished. I'd also like to generate the poetry more Pythonically, more rule based and programmed, and less explicitly instructed (variable + " " + variable, etc.).

The following quote from Charles Hartman (from his *Virtual Muse*) is highly germane to this kind of work, and was lodged in my mind as I was working: "The readerâ€™s mind works most actively on sparse materials. We draw the clearest constellations from the fewest stars. So, the nonsense factor is low for a tiny collocation of words that can be imbued with imagistic significance."

I think it is very fragile work maintaining the balance between that auspicious, even fortuitous zone of sense (or sensible non-sense), and a random, garbled motley of unintentionally assembled words.

The reader is often willing to do the work to fill in the gaps of randomness, ascribing or projecting sense, intention, or even a frisson at the chance congregation of several words. But the program must give the reader something to work with. There is too little intention and definition to my current design.
