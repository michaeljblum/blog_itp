The idea, and all its implications, of data as an “art material” is one that, though I’ve confronted it in sundry contexts, pieces, and performances over the years, I’d never actually explicitly considered.

In part because there is simply so, so much of “data”—all different kinds and always ever more—it’s easy to fail to consciously come to terms with it, both in life and in art. And it is sometimes especially easy to miss in art when the data is less monumental, explicit, or striking (namely, in cases other than war and atrocity memorials or the obvious cataloguing of smaller or more personal datasets). 

These readings got me thinking especially on the relation between data—its largely unconscious, excessive accumulation; its collection by a variety of organizations and corporations, and the role it plays in their decision-making—and the self—its constitution, its representation, and its uniqueness or genericness. With regards to this tangent, Dan Weiskopf’s piece was particularly enlightening. 

The aspect of his piece that I found most interesting was his elaboration on some of the tensions involved in this relation between self and data. For instance, that we (each of us, us “selves”) are at once subject and object of this data, are at once “creators, custodians, and products” of it. And that “our” data (or the data of us but that we aren’t, in every case, owners of) is at once one of the most reliable markers of our individuality, objectively speaking (if everything is working correctly, the data of me represents absolutely no one but me), and also a tool frequently used to compress, categorize, manipulate, organize, control, and efface individuality (from recommendation engines to targeted advertising to predictive policing and other forms of profiling). 

As Weiskopf writes, “...as more of our lives become logged in databases, algorithms for automatically searching text and images will discover even more similarities among us, and more recondite clas­sifications. The more we share, the better these algorithms can organize us, and the more they will reduce the space within which we can live out our individual subjectivity.”

Weiskopf takes issue with the “forefront of aesthetics and data visualization,” as, to his mind, the fact that many of its leading figures have worked in the search and social media industries gives rise to “a form of technological complicity in which [their projects and works] themselves may easily transform into low-grade forms of voyeurism and surveillance.”

This caution, although based in too-broad a generalization, nevertheless makes some sense. And it arouses in me a curiosity as to whether there is a form of “data aesthetics” that is at once conscientious of, and potentially grapples with the complex dynamics between self and data mapped out above, that nonetheless does not simply revolve around techniques of obfuscation, “jamming” the system, or performing invisibility (highlighting gaps in the data, or creating or becoming those gaps). This latter strategy of art-making—I should call it, rather, a technique, as it is moreso a statement than anything like a strategy (which might imply organization, intervention, resistance, scale, etc.)—is pretty prevalent in art that actively thinks about data, its accumulation, and control. 

One alternative, in the domain of data and aesthetics, is an art that confronts and inquires into the speculative horizon of individuality, selves, and selfhood in light of the nature of the aforementioned relation between data and self, and particularly the impact of the former on the latter (and the repercussions for how the latter is understood, sensed, planned for, etc.). This is a line of questioning opened up to particularly fruitful effect in portions of Benjamin Bratton’s The Stack. Weiskopf has some salient things to say about it as well:

“Data portraits, then, can no longer rely on a narrative understanding of their subjects' lives and character. Sometimes objects retrieved by querying a data­base can be assembled into narratives, but it is equally possible to retrieve a ran­dom collection of items with no such connection. Databases and search engines can encode similarities and categories that we cannot easily name or grasp, and these algorithmically generated classifications resist our everyday practices of interpretation. With no convenient storyline to grasp and organize their experi­ence, the challenge for artists interested in questions of identity then becomes how to use these same tools of data manipulation to portray the strangeness of post-narrative selfhood.”
